# Betris: a 100% original game*

An in-progress OpengGL implementation of Tetris. Simply done to see if I could.

## FEATURES:

- Uses SRS (standard rotation system) to solve roatations in complience with the standard tetris rule sets. T-spin to win.
- Basic scoring.
- Holding pieces, seeing your next pieces and and outline of where your current piece will land.

## UPCOMING FEATURES

- Menus that allow the entering of the main game, as well as a reset screen when the game ends.
- Add varying levels based on performance.
- Add full scoring system (T-spins, back-to-back difficult clears).
- General polish (text centering, QoL).
- Implementation of audio.
- Raytracing*.

## CONTROLS:

A and D to move piece left or right.

Q and E to rotate the piece left or right.

S to drop the current piece faster (soft drop).

SPACE to drop the current piece instantly (hard drop).

C to swap/hold current piece.
